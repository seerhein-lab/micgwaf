micgwaf demo
============

This project is a demo application to demonstrate how to implement a web application using micgwaf.
It represents a book store, where an administrator can add, edit and remove books.

Building
--------

The application is built using maven. 
Call e.g. "mvn package" to create a war bundle, or "mvn eclipse:eclipse" to create an eclipse 
configuration for the project.
Within eclipse, run or debug the class de.seerheinlab.test.micgwaf.Start to start the web application
(or deploy the packaged war to a servlet container of your choice).
